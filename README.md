Module 6 Challenge Files
WeatherPy

python-api-challenge/WeatherPy/WeatherPy.ipynb

    The purpose of this notebook is to fetch geographical data using a get request to an API and perform various operations on that data along with exporting data for presentation and future analysis.
    There are various scatterplots which display latitude versus different pieces of weather data such as temperature, humidity and wind speed. The data is then divided by hemisphere and linear regressions are performed on the data.

VacationPy

python-api-challenge/WeatherPy/VacationPy.ipynb

    This purpose of this notebook is to use the exported data from WeatherPy to generate maps that present the data in different ways, ultimately filtering the data and querying an API to find ideal vacation destinations and hotels in those locations.

Output Data

python-api-challenge/WeatherPy/output_data

    This directory contains files exported from the WeatherPy notebook including a .csv file containing weather data for various cities and four .png files of the scatterplots generated in the WeatherPy notebook.
    The cities.csv file is used in the VacationPy notebook.
